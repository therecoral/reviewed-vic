Schiavello,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/schiavello-813537,1.0,"Small minded, micro managed, no opportunities to progress unless you're family. Lack of upskilling opportunities.",
Schiavello,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/schiavello-813537,4.0,The politics of construction,
Schiavello,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/schiavello-813537,1.0,Company culture & behaviour is lacking and so is the professionalism. Every BU is its own clique. Collaboration & knowledge sharing are alien concepts. Staff would rather remain in their own silos and gossip about each other instead of achieving meaningful work together.,
Schiavello,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/schiavello-813537,1.0,Constantly micromanaged and a lack of investment in system and IT improving efficiencies and communications.,
Schiavello,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/schiavello-813537,1.0,"Very Noisy , no real opportunity to get to know any other staff during work hours, fast paced, repetitive and joyless. Training is very much on the job - with no proper trainer or training regime - just other staff used to teach new staff. For example I was there less than 3 months, and still learning things myself when I was teamed up with a new staff member and expected to teach them. So no uniformity with training at all. Also - asking for a day off whilst still in your probation period was met with hostility from floor manager. Being sick was also frowned upon. Its all about the work & the Output- regardless of the health/safety of staff. Its one of those places that will say they are doing everything to keep people safe - but really they are really just doing the legal minimum ( and perhaps sometimes less). Any suggestions to make something better or safer for staff are ignored if it would reduce the output.",
Schiavello,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/schiavello-813537,4.0,"As with all businesses, the challenge of navigating the export side of business it was quite tricky at times. I think better ways of communication could have been implemented in order to achieve the best outcome.",
Schiavello,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/schiavello-813537,4.0,"There are always challenges in most things we do. Navigating through them to achieve a positive outcome. Continuously looking for qualified staff, Finding the balance to be cost competitive and selling a project.",

,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,3.0,Since the merge ABN has become very bureaucratic with a high staff turnover. We now see lots of team leaders and managers in roles they may not be experienced enough for. There is no accountability on departments and too many responsibilities now lie with the construction team.,
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,5.0,,Administration Role
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,5.0,"ABN Group is a fast-paced, ever-changing workplace. Not for everyone, some people don't like the constant change and expectation to rise to the standard. There certainly is a culture of working hard but with the right managers, it doesn't go unnoticed by leadership and is paid off with many perks.",
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,4.0,"There has been a reliance on traditional processes, and some initial hesitation around change - however, this is gradually shifting.",
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,5.0,"Being a larger business, there has been times when collaboration between departments has been challenging, but the groups focus on continual learning and improvement has meant this is being addressed as part of the current business plan.",
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,5.0,Nothing major. Pay is average to start with.,
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,2.0,"There seems to be little room for growth or advancement within the company, which can be demotivating for long-term career planning. Salary is not competitive compared to similar roles in the industry, which may not align with the effort and pace of the work environment. The fast-paced environment, while engaging, can sometimes lead to burnout or difficulty maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Limited training opportunities and a lack of focus on personal or professional development can make it hard to upskill or feel valued. Efforts and dedication unnoticed by the reporting manager, with little to no recognition or appreciation from the management.",
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,1.0,"Over worked and a stressful work environment, not verry supportive management. Low salary.",
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,4.0,"Limited possibility to moove forward. Pay is not as high as other places. Providing opportunity and assistance to educate in your field of department, is although encouraged and claim to support, is actually not carried through when you request it.",
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,5.0,For someone joining us from outside the industry you need to be curious and open to learning new things quickly. We work at a fast pace which can take a while to get used to.,
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,1.0,"Low pay, the management and culture is horrible. With the low pay they only retain sub standard management and anyone of value usually doesn’t last for more then 12/18 months.",
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,3.0,High staff turnover. Limited growth opportunities. Most of team member underpaid after few years working here. Staff can be overburdened without sufficient support. Transformation team in place at moment lack of focus of loyalty staff,
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,1.0,No flexible working arrangements Mixed messaging and conflicting direction from management. Departments can be very cliquey. Experienced disrespectful comments about my culture from some staff. Management gaslight you into thinking you are being paid well but it’s far below average pay.,
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,1.0,"Management, pay is average and they expect the absolute world from you.",
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,4.0,Very fast paced industry. A lot happening with very conflicting timelines to get tasks completed.,
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,5.0,"The size and breadth of what they do is a double-edged sword. While ABN Group does a lot in the industry, the wide diversity of work and roles can cause a little confusion at times. But that's all part of a big company that continues to grow and evolve.",
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,5.0,"Environment is face paced, you won't have a problem if you work hard and enjoy a challenge, but this place isn't for someone wanting to sit back and be lazy.",
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,1.0,Having to “fit in” so you don’t get constant management or HR meetings. The compulsory events for staff. The challenge of fitting in attending everything when you have a life makes it not a nice place to work. High staff turnover was a big issue. Most people leave after 12-18 months which meant more issues with clients due to inexperienced staff. I saw many people with experience leave and go to different companies with better incentives or rewards. The clashes between operations and sales. There are constantly issues between the two departments which makes the office environment sometimes stressful for staff. Having to work 7 days a week and manage a life outside of the company. Management micromanage and place extra pressure to achieve targets constantly moving the goal post. OVERALL it was a good learning experience just not somewhere one can build a career due to it being un-sustainable long-term for most people. I felt like it was a good learning experience for a young person at the beginning of their career.,
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,4.0,High staff turnover at present,
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,5.0,"There's not necessarily anything 'difficult' here at ABN. Sure, the workloads are large but that's not a negative. Increased workloads is a great factor for the business plus we are very much supported here so you never feel like you're drowning. If you speak up, Management will jump straight away to offer assistance.",
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,5.0,Like everyone lockdowns and restrictions made 2020 / 2021 challenging however ABN Group were ahead of the game making flexible work arrangements for staff.,
,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/abn-group-806732,1.0,"I was warned about working for this company by a few people. I decided to take the offer and work for the company. Offer was made, I accepted, left my existing job.... 2 days before starting, I get a call and being told the offer was rescinded. No compensation was given, offered, or even considered. Basically told ""oh well, deal with it""",

I also mentioned in my review about IT Management as a whole, how toxic it is. I spoke not only for myself, but for current and former employees. My review was based on factual occurrences and not personal grievances. This shows that this is a company wide issue, BGIS has swept it under the rug. By removing the review, it tells me the inaction and unaccountability on the director and IT management. I even escalated all these problems all the way up to global, but by deleting this review, I now understand BGIS's true intent and colours- which is to protect senior leadership at any cost. Just do not ever work for this company please, they have no problem to sacrifice employee well-being to shield toxic leadership. Their solution is EAP and not actually taking accountability and action to remove the problem. Even though I have been so professional, giving you the benefit of the doubt, but now, BGIS, you have truly are a disappointment. Anyone who is looking to apply for this role, just don't, you'll be working under the Director of IT and they are here to stay- BGIS will take zero accountability. Go for a company that actually values its employees and has zero tolerance for favoring toxic senior leadership.",

Management don’t look after hard workers as they feel threatened by their knowledge and skill set. Huge turn over of staff! So you will spend most of your days covering for those that leave or get the boot and then have to train the next person who usually is gone within a couple of months so it is a cycle you can not help or keep up with when your own workload is so high. Work loads with unrealistic deadlines get dropped on you when you are already so inundated and if you request support you will be told no and that the request is fair and reasonable. Roles and responsibilities will be changed overnight without any formal communication or support, you will be expected to just know that discussions have taken place with management and things have changed or u hear it via gossip from other team members.

Going to work feels like walking on eggshells because you'd never know if you are suddenly picked on due to some mistake you made days ago - even if you've been doing the same things as everyone else. If the managers feel challenged by you, they'd use their position to smear your name to the higher-ups, and they'd do it during work hours so that you are publicly shamed.

,https://www.seek.com.au/companies/hickory-1030979,2.0,"The flip-side would be that there are unrealistic work-load expectations placed on the team, which was very short-staffed for a commercial team. This created a demanding work environment as staff were asked to undertake tasks and responsibilities well-outside their roles to make-up for the lack of numbers (i.e. a Site Foreman, a Safety Officer, a Site Engineer / Cadet, etc.). With regards to contract administration and design coordination, I personally felt that there was a lot of unnecessary risk taken on from a Head Contractor. Additionally, through my experiences on the project, communicating, coordinating and receiving information from our own suppliers in China for prefabricated structural and façade elements was beyond difficult (much easier to deal with external subcontractors). Between supervising works on-site & day-to-day site tasks and the coordination & administration side of things in the office, an 80-hour minimum working week is the norm here (6 days a week mandatory). This realistically cannot be sustained. The main reason I decided to resign was the way the company handled the coronavirus pandemic back in mid-March 2020 - half the team was placed on standby for approximately 3 months and additionally there was a freeze on hiring much needed site staff. This was despite the project moving forward at a greater pace (as Council DA hours were extended). Talking with colleagues from previous companies, this was not the case at their workplace.",

In major hospitals, the workload can be overwhelming — it keeps piling up with no signs of slowing down. Burnout can happen quickly, and unfortunately, raising concerns with HR or management rarely leads to any real change. Most of the time, I worked alone without much support. Communication often felt one-sided, with little acknowledgment or response. In some cases, you may even feel targeted, especially if you’re repeatedly assigned to certain hospitals with heavier demands. That said, I was fortunate to have some amazing colleagues who were supportive and helped me learn the ropes. Without them, the experience would’ve been much tougher. Sadly, hard work often goes unrecognized, and rewards or appreciation are rare. The constant drama in the workplace only adds to the stress. I hope for the better in the future.",

You're expexted to be positive all the time. • Perks being rescinded (flexible working arrangements & no pay rise mandate in April 2024). • People talk behind your back. • Little to no opportunities for development or department transfers deapite Development Dollars initiative. It's extremely hard to meet the criteria to acceas funding due to sparse scheduling of workshops you must attend and high workload not allowing you the time. • Department and Line management play favourites- you won't get promoted or recognised if you're not one. Even if you kiss a** and burn yourself out trying to prove yourself. • For a company who values ""celebrating success"", many hard working employees feel apathetic and frankly cynical because any recognition that is shared is just between office cliques. Not genuine at all. • Junior-Mid level employees are overworked, undervalued, and underpaid by industry standards. • Junior-Mid level employees train their frankly unqualified line managers and continually get taken advantage of for their good work ethic. • Mistakes and missed budgets are punished, you'll feel like dirt at times. Upper management and the board have some KPIs which are too high for a post-COVID, recession bound economy. Unfortunately MFG is becoming more of a toxic place to work each day. A fancy rebrand, new work ""social media"" platform, staff discounts, and free coffee (for now) isn't enough to raise morale or retain employees. Those things are nice, but they won't keep a roof over heads and they don't really help people feel that good about soming to work. There's just a lot of PR talk to make things seem like sunshine and rainbows but employees can see through the farse. Junior-Mid level employees should be paid more for all the things they endure. This is across all departments at head office, the DC, and retail stores. At this point, there's nothing to suggest. Being retail, this company exists to make a profit and unfortunately employyes suffer in order to make that happen. I hope they don't resort to redundancies to meet their targets. I sincerely hope things inprove at MFG, I've heard that employees used to think the culture was great and that they felt looked after. I never experienced that.",

Since moving to the city 3 years ago, pretty much all senior managers were either asked to go or shortly left of their own accord. They have been replaced with people from a predominantly financial background. This has resulted in business strategies more akin to profit making than for a mutual, member based company. 'Member benefits' is constantly bandied around but there is little improvement in the offer. While I agree with the overall direction for which RACV is aiming, there is a distinct lack of specific planning and vision. No one really knows how we are going to get there. Workers are given broad and vague goals and when things don't work, there is another restructure. There has been little significant change since the new CEO started over 4 years ago.",

There’s a strong sense of disconnection between management and the people actually doing the work. Many decisions seem to be made by people who haven’t set foot on a site in years, yet they dictate how things should be done without understanding the realities or constraints technicians face. Instead of collaboration and support, there’s often a culture of blame and micromanagement. Some managers are more focused on politics, covering themselves, or chasing numbers than supporting their teams. Raising issues or suggesting improvements can easily get you labelled as “negative” rather than being taken seriously.
